# contour_segmation
this is a repository for CT contour segmation use assd model for the first step

1. figure out how to load RT_st and match into the ct image
2. get coordinates of the contours
3. find out whether the poing is inside or outside the contour
4. use formula 4 or 6 to calculate different Fsd
5. use different Fsd to simulate new contours
